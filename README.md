# D&D Item Icons

Most of these icons are colourised versions of items from [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/), some are slightly edited, some are heavily edited, and a few are originals by me trying to harmonise with the aesthetics of other icons.

## Examples
![Examples of original icons and modified versions](/Examples/Icons%20Examples.webp)


## The module includes 
- Most mundane items from Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) and Player Handbook (PHB)
    - Adventuring Gear
    - Ammunition
    - Armour
    - Food and Drink
    - Gaming Sets
    - Instruments
    - Mounts
    - Spellcasting foci
    - Tools, Kits, and Artisan Tools
    - Trade Good
    - Vehicles
    - Weapons
- Some Treasure items from DMG and PHB. (Some oddly specific ones have been made more generic.  Some I just didn't feel like making.)
- All Magic Potions from DMG
- Some minor magical items
- Spell components from PHB, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, and Xanathar's Guide to Everything. Nowhere **near** everything, but I've tried to make those things that are very specific, hard to find, has a gold value, and any items that get consumed. Basically anything the DM might argue about whether or not you have. 
- And anything I just felt like making.

Certain items that I find it unreasonable to literally carry around with you, such as livestock and vehicles, are represented by a deed or receipt to keep in your inventory.
Some items come in more than one design for a bit of variety.

## Additional items include:
- A multitude of generic bottles and vials with various coloured content
- Unspecific generic gem stones of a variety of colours
- Scrolls and Books
- Items referred to in starting equipment and toolkits that have no specified individual weight or value listed
- Items of (to me) unknown origin that my party has been awarded in various campaigns
- Things I just felt like making

Items are mostly sorted by type in subfolders.
Some items that have multiple types are placed wherever I feel like it, or in some cases have variants in several folders.
